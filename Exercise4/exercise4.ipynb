    "In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",

    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

Given a training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$, we will first run a “forward pass” to compute all the activations throughout the network, including the output value of the hypothesis $h_\\theta(x)$. Then, for each node $j$ in layer $l$, we would like to compute an “error term” $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ that measures how much that node was “responsible” for any errors in our output.\n",

    "For an output node, we can directly measure the difference between the network’s activation and the true target value, and use that to define $\\delta_j^{(3)}$ (since layer 3 is the output layer). For the hidden units, you will compute $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ based on a weighted average of the error terms of the nodes in layer $(l+1)$. In detail, here is the backpropagation algorithm (also depicted in the figure above). You should implement steps 1 to 4 in a loop that processes one example at a time. Concretely, you should implement a for-loop `for t in range(m)` and place steps 1-4 below inside the for-loop, with the $t^{th}$ iteration performing the calculation on the $t^{th}$ training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$. Step 5 will divide the accumulated gradients by $m$ to obtain the gradients for the neural network cost function.\n",

Perform a feedforward pass, computing the activations $(z^{(2)}, a^{(2)}, z^{(3)}, a^{(3)})$ for layers 2 and 3. Note that you need to add a `+1` term to ensure that the vectors of activations for layers $a^{(1)}$ and $a^{(2)}$ also include the bias unit.

    "One way to understand what your neural network is learning is to visualize what the representations captured by the hidden units. Informally, given a particular hidden unit, one way to visualize what it computes is to find an input $x$ that will cause it to activate (that is, to have an activation value \n",
    "($a_i^{(l)}$) close to 1). For the neural network you trained, notice that the $i^{th}$ row of $\\Theta^{(1)}$ is a 401-dimensional vector that represents the parameter for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit. If we discard the bias term, we get a 400 dimensional vector that represents the weights from each input pixel to the hidden unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, one way to visualize the “representation” captured by the hidden unit is to reshape this 400 dimensional vector into a 20 × 20 image and display it (It turns out that this is equivalent to finding the input that gives the highest activation for the hidden unit, given a “norm” constraint on the input (i.e., $||x||_2 \\le 1$)). \n",

    "In this part of the exercise, you will get to try out different learning settings for the neural network to see how the performance of the neural network varies with the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ and number of training steps (the `maxiter` option when using `scipy.optimize.minimize`). Neural networks are very powerful models that can form highly complex decision boundaries. Without regularization, it is possible for a neural network to “overfit” a training set so that it obtains close to 100% accuracy on the training set but does not as well on new examples that it has not seen before. You can set the regularization $\\lambda$ to a smaller value and the `maxiter` parameter to a higher number of iterations to see this for youself."
